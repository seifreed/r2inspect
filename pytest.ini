# Output and formatting options
# Note: To limit parallelism with pytest-xdist, use: pytest -n 1
# The default runs tests sequentially to avoid overwhelming the machine with r2 processes
#
# Resource-saving tips for running tests:
#   1. Tests run with R2INSPECT_TEST_MODE=1 automatically (via conftest.py)
#   2. This enables shorter timeouts and lighter analysis (aa vs aaa)
#   3. Memory limited to 1GB, CPU to 5 minutes by default
#   4. To skip r2-heavy tests: pytest -m "not requires_r2"
#   5. To run only unit tests: pytest -m unit
#   6. Install pytest-timeout for per-test timeouts: pip install pytest-timeout

markers =
    unit: Unit tests for individual components

    slow: Tests that take longer to execute
    requires_r2: Tests that require radare2 to be installed
    requires_ssdeep: Tests that require ssdeep library
    requires_tlsh: Tests that require tlsh library
    resource_intensive: Tests that spawn multiple r2 processes or consume significant resources
